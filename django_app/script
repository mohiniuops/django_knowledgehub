Hey , We will write ansible playbook to see our git configurations. Ummm . Dont be afraid of failure . Make a habit to of finding all ways to fail before you success Let Start writing our playbook. Start with 3 dashes --- , usual way to start yml file Give Name to your file yml file as dash space name colon playbook to see git configurations One next line , dash hosts and then for now lets keep it as all , as we havent written inventory file yet Lets take help of ansible-doc to see what all packages are available to us for seeing our git configuration type ansible dash doc dash eell to list all module and then pipe grep git Let use git_config To see see examples for using git underscore config, let again use ansible doc to see usage ansible dash doc space git underscore config The simplest example is to list git_config with only one parameter . Lets do our simple copy paste We have copied this git_config example to use straight away . Let continue with out yml file now. Vee Iee git_con dot yaml file Write tasks just below hosts without any extra space . Indentation on hosts & tasks should be same Always give name to your each task . Put a space then dash then again a space and then write name. These spaces often irritates I will give name to our task as list all git configurations Now without any extra space write your module_name as git underscore config Please remember , no extra spaces between name and color or between module name and column Now copy paste the doc example here list underscore all , no space colon then yes And by default scope is global.
